# Summary
This repo contains the lab exercises that accompany a two-day introductory Splunk Class. The class is currently targeted at Splunk Version 9.4.4 (the most recent 9 series version) due to a major client not yet having transitioned to Splunk 10.
It is our goal to make the labs as useful and readable as possible.

# Format
The main component for these exercises is a series of /labs/lab-##.md Markdown files that describe the individual steps that students need to take in order to try out / learn something about Splunk.

# Content
The labs reference screenshots found in the /img folder and datasets (to be uploaded by student to their individual Splunk VMs) found in /data.
The labs are meant to exercise concepts that are introduced in the /src/Splunk-Boot-Camp.pdf slide deck, which can be referenced to ensure any new concepts are actually taught to students.
