# Search Examples
Time: 20 minutes

## Instructions
Let's start doing simple searches in Splunk by applying the concepts we've reviewed so far. Instead of just copying and pasting search queries, this time you'll create yours based on the data from the main index (the data that Eventgen is sending).

### Enabling the "Full" Search Assistant
The search bar has a Search Assistant that provides robust autocomplete capabilities. We can go even further by switching the Search Assistant from "Compact" mode to "Full" mode.
1. In top nav, click "Administrator" (currently logged in user), then click "Preferences"
1. Click "SPL Editor" tab
1. Change "Search Assistant" setting to "Full"

### Create Simple Searches
Search operators are really important in Splunk, and it's common to use them in almost every search. You'll start practicing with simple operators like `NOT`, `OR`, and `AND` operators we saw in class. So this time, you need to do the following:

Create a simple Search:

- 6.1 - Display events with __destinations__ to __NY__ or __MIA__
- 6.2 - Display events with __destinations__ to __AK__ or __LAX__
- 6.3 - Display events that are __destinations__ not to __SEA__
- 6.4 - Create any search where you combine two or more different operators (AND, OR, NOT)
