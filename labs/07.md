# Search Examples II
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
This time, instead of copying and pasting queries, you'll try to do the searches on your own. You can ask questions or reread the information from the slide deck. (In the notes, you'll find the links to the official docs.)

**Make sure you save the searches. You'll need them later**

### Time Ranges
Using the data you uploaded previously in lab #3, answer the following questions (you might not need to create complex queries if you inspect all the elements in `Search & Reporting` app dashboard):

- 7.1 - What's the most common __top brand__ in __2018__?
- 7.2 - What's the period of time for the data? (Use the `Format Timeline` graph)
- 7.3 - How many events are for __October__?
- 7.4 - How many events are in __2017__?
- 7.5 - How many events are exclusively for the __top brand__ __`Cricket Wireless`__? _Inspect how the data is being stored for the brand field. You'll need to escape the characters and be specific in the search term. Spoiler alert: the number is greater than 1,000 and lower than 1,050._
- 7.6 - How many events are exclusively for the __top brand__ __`McDonalds`__? Bonus: Can you find how many events include __`McDonalds`__ in the __top brand__ list?

If you want, you can save each search. We'll talk about that later. But just in case you finish early...;)

### Using the Search App
Now, this time, try to use the search app or the UI to answer the questions below. It's even better if you can create the queries from scratch, but start slowly by using the UI.

But first, let's upload more data again. This time, upload the data from [Google Play Store Apps](../data/google-play-store-apps.zip).

- 7.7 - What's the __third__ most popular __category__?
- 7.8 - What are the __top three__ apps with a __rating__ of __five__ in __August, 2018__?
- 7.9 - How many events exist that support __Android__ __version `5.0 and up`__?  Bonus: Can you find the number of __apps__ that exist that support __Android__ __version `5.0 and up`__?
- 7.10 - How many __installations__ for the __`Bowmasters`__ app? _Use the `Installs` field, you may need to click on "more fields" to see it._
- 7.11 - What are the __paid__ apps with __more than "500,000+" installations__? _Notice the "more then" this would also include "1,000,000+"._
- 7.12 - What's the most common __sentiment__ for the __`Facebook`__ app? _Positive or negative?_
- 7.13 - What's the __rating__ value for the __`Twitter`__ app?
