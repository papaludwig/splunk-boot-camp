# Dashboards
Time: 30 minutes

## Instructions
There will be times when you'd need to have a graphic to represent the status of your systems. You can save any search as a chart and combine it with other widgets like searches or reports. The purpose of this so you can have several critical monitoring pieces in one place.

### Saving Searches
For the following search query:

```
sourcetype=access_custom http_status_code=200| top limit=20 http_uri
```

- Save the search as a report
- Configure a time range picker
- Edit the permissions of the report to share it with everyone

### Create a Report from a Chart
For the following search query:

```
sourcetype=access_custom http_status_code=200 | timechart avg(http_response_time)
```

- In the "Visualizations" tab, pick "Line Chart"
- Change the format so that legends are visible in the chart
- Save as a report

### Create Dashboards
For the following search query:

```
sourcetype=access_custom| top limit=20 http_status_code
```

- Click the "Visualization" tab and change it to a "Pie Chart"
- Save it as a private dashboard panel
- Set a dashboard and panel title and click on "Save"
- Click on "View Dashboard"
- Click on "Edit" and click on "+ Add Input"
- Select "Time"
- Edit the input and set a label name
- For "Token," type `datetime`
- For "Default," change it to `Last 15 minutes`
- Click on "Apply"

Now let's edit the search query for the visualization:

- In the dashboard panel, click on "Edit Search" (at top-right corner's chart)
- In the "Time Range" section, change "Shared Time Picker (datetime)"
- Click on "Apply"
- Click on "Save"
- Make sure everything is working by using different time ranges or even changing the visualization, like a table.
