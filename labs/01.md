## Instructions

In this lab, we'll review the environment, making sure that Splunk is running in the server provided. 


## Primary Login (Splunk WebUI)

Confirm that you have access to the Splunk UI using the IP provided with port 8000, like this: http://{{SPLUNK_HOST}}:8000/. Replace `SPLUNK_HOST` with your Splunk Public IP.

Use the following credentials:

- username: `admin`
- password: `SplunkB00tcamp`

### Review the App
Make sure that the app called `SA-Eventgen` is already created. You can check this in the left panel of the Home page.

### Event Generator
We're using the [SA-Eventgen](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/) app to simulate real-time events. SA-Eventgen is already installed, but it's disabled. So let's enable it to start receiving events:

- Go to `Settings` (top menu)
- Then click on `Data inputs`
- In the Local Inputs section, click on `Eventgen`
- Click on the `Enable` link from the status column
- Go to the `Destinations` app again.  In the search box enter the following to verify that events are being generated by the "SA-Eventgen":
    `index="main" source="weblog" sourcetype="access_custom"  host="www.destinations.com"`

## Secondary Login (Linux SSH)
A few of the labs expect Shell access.  We will utilize SSH for this.  If you are not comfortable with SSH or the Linux Shell the Instructor can help. To access the Splunk server through SSH use the following credentials:

- Username: `student`
- Password: `splunk`
